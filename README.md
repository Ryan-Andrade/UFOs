# UFOs
 
## Overview
 The purpose of this analysis is to present a visualization of a UFO sighting data set utilizing JavaScript and it's D3 library, HTML and CSS.

## Results
 Hello Dana as you can see our webpage displays the entirety of the UFO sighting data set as an HTML table. However if you look here (https://postimg.cc/K374CgqD) you will see filters that are put in place to help narrow down search criteria for our users. In order for a user to filter their results they will have to enter in a criteria that matches the grey lettering in the search box. After they have entered their search term all that needs to happen next is for them to click in another area outside of the search box and the tables will filter from there.

## Drawback
One potential drawback that I can see from this webpage design is the headers are manually coded and I would recommend a function to code the header column automatically.
